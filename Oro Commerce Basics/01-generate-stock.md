Your Steps Explained

When you open OroCommerce for the first time, you might initially be overwhelmed by the number of menu items and configuration options that it offers. Don't panic, players, we are going to explain it all! We'll take you step by step through all basic setup and configuration to help you kick-start your sales quickly.

You may want to start by uploading all your products into the Oro master catalog. The master catalog organizes all existing products in your store under corresponding categories. For instance, your master catalog might have such categories as insulation, bricks, roofing, plumbing, electricals, and tiles. Each such category combines products of a similar type into groups and helps enforce the unified selling strategy by configuring a special set of product options, visibility, and SEO settings that best fit the resulting product family. By default, there is only one master catalog in OroCommerce, but you can personalize it the way you need, by adding or deleting categories, creating groups of products and linking them to the corresponding web catalog.

Think of the master catalog as a storage room, and a web catalog as your shop window. You keep all your products in the storage room but display only some of them in a certain way in the shop window. In the master catalog, you organize, categorize, and keep all your products, but your web catalog helps present these products in a personalized way that fits your target audience. The perk of OroCommerce is that it provides an almost infinite number of possibilities for personalized web catalogs, as the application comes out-of-the-box complete with versatile catalog management capabilities.

With the products imported and master and web catalogs created, your next step would be to upload your inventory to the warehouse. Inventory in OroCommerce helps you track the availability of your products in one or more warehouses, display it for the buyer and salespeople, and automatically adjust it after every operation in OroCommerce. You can manage product inventory by both 3rd party solutions and via OroCommerce, depending on how you prefer to control your stock.

When that's done, you proceed to add prices to your products. In OroCommerce, you can easily set up and customize multiple price lists for your customers, customer groups, and websites, build price lists with any amount of price points, price tiers, or currencies. Creating a price list couldn't be easier; just upload your existing price list into OroCommerce. Besides, you can even schedule temporary or permanent price changes.

To make sure that your customer can negotiate a quote, pay for the purchased items, and have them delivered to their address, add payment and shipping solutions next. For payment, you need to create certain payment terms and bind payment methods to particular customers. You also add rules to make payment case-specific. By integrating with the desired shipping providers and setting shipping rules, you can bind buyers to shipping methods, based on location or other attributes at checkout.

Although the course is going to concentrate on the key steps leading up to the first sale, along the way, we will be introducing additional concepts and providing links to Oro media and documentation libraries to make sure you are familiar with the full picture of capabilities and benefits of the OroCommerce product.


Organize the Master Catalog

The first step of your OroCommerce journey is setting up your own master catalog. Before populating it with products, we suggest that you create a couple of categories to add the products to. This helps to structure and organize products that you are selling.

For our example of an office stationery supplies website (OroAcme), we are going to create four categories. Later, we will upload products to the categories that correspond to their type. The categories are:

Paper and Mailing
Writing Supplies
Desktop Accessories
Presentation Equipment
To reach the default master catalog, navigate to Products > Master Catalog in the main menu.

The All Products category is the default category available out-of-the-box with your application.

To add more categories to the catalog, click Create Category on the top right. For the basic setup, it is enough to provide the following key information:

Title — A meaningful name for the category. Click the Translations icon to provide spelling for different languages. Click the Default Language icon to return to the single-language view.
Description — A short and/or long description of the category you are creating.
URL Slug — A web address generated automatically once the title of the category is defined. It is used to build a human-readable URL for the product page in the storefront.
As at this point, we have no products uploaded to the application. The Products section is empty.

In the Default Product Options section, you can adjust the default settings for the products in your category. You can read more about product options in the documentation library's relevant master catalog (https://doc.oroinc.com/user/back-office/products/master-catalog/) topic.

In the panel to the left, we have created four categories.

For more complex setups, you can also add subcategories to the categories. This way, for instance,  the Paper and Mailing category might further be split into Paper, Mailroom, or Envelopes subcategories, if necessary.

Now that we have categories to organize the products into, we can start adding stock information.
